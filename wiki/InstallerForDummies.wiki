#Description about the new installer

= Introduction =

The new 0xdroid installer supports install to NAND or to SD/MMC, and can fetch images from network. And the installation process is extremely simple: just extract the files into the SD card. 

= Details =

== Install to NAND ==

=== Supported files ===

  * 0xkernel-beagle.bin the kernel image
  * android-beagle.bin the root file system image
  * flash-uboot.bin the boot loader image

== Install to SD/MMC ==

Place a file *00_INSTALL_TO_SDCARD* into the SD card, then the installer will not overwrite the NAND instead of write to the SD card.

***CAUTION*** The installer reformat the SD card if the partitions doesn't match the Android requirement. The reformat process might damage the existing data on the card.

== Install from network ==

Put the file *00_NET_INSTALL* into the SD card. This file must define following variables:
{{{
IFACE=usb0  #optional
IPADDRESS=192.168.0.202
REMOTE_UIMAGE=http://192.168.0.201:8000/0xkernel-beagle.bin
REMOTE_ROOTFS=http://192.168.0.201:8000/android-beagle.ubi
}}}

The host side can setup the usb network on demand, for example, in Debian/Ubuntu system add the following lines to /etc/network/interfaces
{{{
allow-hotplug usb0
iface usb0 inet static
      address 192.168.0.201
      netmask 255.255.255.0
}}}
