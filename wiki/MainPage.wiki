= Our focus =

The focus of this Wiki is to centralize 0xdroid specific information and how to get it running on the Beagleboard / TI OMAP3 derived boards.  The Wiki includes information on how to [UsingPreBuiltImages download and install 0xdroid], how to use specific parts (like the [MouseAction mouse actions]), what features of the 0xdroid are currently functional and how you can contribute to improve the release.

= Development Goal =

The reason why [http://0xlab.org/ 0xlab] has to construct yet another project derived from Android is that we wish to exploit the ability of certain hardware SoC and leverage the existing open source software work.  So, 0xdroid is not only regarded as Android porting project but also an open environment to introduce several new features, improvement, and community-driven feedbacks, that implies it is fairly possible to facilitate more hardware peripherals, extended devices, and improve software re-usability.
  * ARM SoC: dedicated to Beaglboard and TI OMAP3 derived platforms
  * Peripheral support
    * Device: WiFi, Bluetooth, WebCam, Accelerometer, GSM modem / 3G data card
    * Software: corresponding software development such as Bluetooth OBEX.
  * Performance: use NEON instruction set introduced in ARM Cortex A8, and enable SoC specific functionality to accelerate the computing such as video playback.
  * Multimedia
  * Usability and visual enhancements

For detailed 0xdroid development roadmap and status, please check wiki page: [Roadmap].
