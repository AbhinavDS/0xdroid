#summary This page discusses using the pre-built 0xdroid images on Beagleboard/Devkit8000 quickly.

= Introduction =

We provide the pre-built images and also come with a happy Installer. We can use the images and then get the newest Android in Beagleboard or Devkit8000. It would take only few minutes to achieve it. Besides these pre-buit images, we can [Source build from scratch] and gain the images too. There are a couple of ways to do this, primarily a NAND boot or an SD card boot.

== Obtain Prebult Images ==

You can fetch the pre-built images from [http://downloads.0xlab.org/release/ 0xdroid  official release] or the experimental [http://downloads.0xlab.org/dailybuild/ images built by daily-build host], then follow the instructions to install into Beagleboard/Devkit8000 environment. 

NOTE: for newer Beagleboard (rev C4), you need to rename "uImage.bin" to uImage (on the SD card) for the default bootloader to pick it up.

== Installation ==

Make sure that Beagleboard hardware is properly set up first.  Check wiki page [hardware_beagleboard] in advance.  You can either use automated approach (for dummies) or go through the details (for geeks).

== from 0xdroid release 0x4 ==

=== Devkit8000 ===
The stock bootloader uses a old machine id that does not match upstream registry. So new users have to reflash a newer bootloader.

 * Prepare the SD card as described above. Then unzip the release image onto the VFAT partition.
{{{
cd /media/sdb1
unzip ~/devkit8k-eclair-0x4.zip
}}}
 * Download the [http://downloads.0xlab.org/release/devkit8k-eclair-0x4/flash-uboot.bin new bootloader] to the same partition.
 * Edit install.conf, uncomment the U_BOOT_IMAGE line.
 * Plug the SD card in Devkit8000 SD slot and restart it.
 * Enter the u-boot prompt, use the following command the chainload the new bootloader.
{{{
mmcinit
fatload mmc 0 80300000 flash-uboot.bin
go 80300000
}}}
 * Then use the new bootloader to load installer
{{{
boot
}}}
 * Wait until all the leds turned on, then the installation is finished.
 * Remove the SD card and reboot.

These steps only have to do once. After the bootloader is updated, the subsequence re-install will be as simple as beagleboard.

== 0xdroid release 0x1~0x3 ==
 * Format the first partition over than 100MB with VFAT on a SD card. 
 * Download the installer [http://downloads.0xlab.org/installer/ uImage.bin] 
 * Download 0xkernel-beagle.bin and android-beagle.ubi from [http://downloads.0xlab.org/release/ release folder]
 * Copy above three files into the first partition of SD/MMC card
 * Plug the SD card in Beagle board SD slot and restart the Beagleboard
 * Wait for UI installer over. The installer would perform NAND flashing and u-boot environment setup.
 * Unplug SD card from the Beagleboard and reboot
 * Enjoy!

==== Format SD card instructions under GNU/Linux ====
 * insert the SD card, wait it been detected, say /dev/mmcblk0 
  * It may be different with different SD device, you can check it via "dmesg")
{{{
dmesg | tail
}}}
  You should see something like -
{{{

}}}
  If you are using the built-in SD/MMC slot, the device name would be /dev/mmcblk?
 * If any partition been mounted automatically, please umount.
 * According to the above device name about SD/MMC, create and format the partitions:
{{{
sudo fdisk /dev/mmcblk0
}}}
 or
{{{
sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
}}}
  * press "d" delete the origin partitions
  * press "n" creating new partition, select partition 1, and give over 100MB to it
  * press "t" and select partition 1. Change the partition label to "b" (W95 FAT32)
   * creating other partitions as you wish (optional)
  * press "p" to confirm the partitions.  The reference output:
{{{

  * press "wq" write back and quit fdisk
 * Format the partition for use:

 or
