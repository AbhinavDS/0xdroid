#summary This page discusses using the pre-built 0xdroid images on Beagleboard quickly.

= Introduction =

Using the pre-built 0xdroid without having to [Source download and build the source] is hopefully working within minutes. There are a couple of ways to do this, primarily a NAND boot and an SD card boot.

== Obtain Prebult Images ==

You can fetch the pre-built images from [http://downloads.0xlab.org/release/ 0xdroid release] or the experimental [http://downloads.0xlab.org/dailybuild/ images built by daily-build host], then follow the instructions to install into Beagleboard environment.

== for dummies ==
 * Format the first partition over than 100MB with VFAT on a SD card. 
 * Download the installer: [http://downloads.0xlab.org/installer/beagle-cupcake-0x2/uImage.bin uImage.bin] into SD card
 * Download [http://downloads.0xlab.org/release/beagle-cupcake-0x2/0xkernel-beagle.bin 0xkernel-beagle.bin]
 * Download [http://downloads.0xlab.org/release/beagle-cupcake-0x2/android-beagle.ubi android-beagle.ubi]
 * Copy the installer uImage.bin image into the first partition of SD/MMC card
 * Copy two files 0xkernel-beagle.bin and android-beagle.ubi into the first partition of SD/MMC card
 * Plug the SD card in beagleboard SD slot and restart the beagleboard
 * Wait for UI installer over.  The installer would perform NAND flashing and u-boot environment setup.
 * Unplug SD card from the Beagleboard and reboot
 * Enjoy!

Format SD card detail under GNU/Linux:
 * insert the SD card, wait it been detected, say /dev/mmcblk0 
  *(It may be different with different SD device, you can check it via "dmesg")
 * If any partition been mounted automatically, please umount them
 * sudo fdisk /dev/mmcblk0
  * press "d" delete the origin partitions
  * press "n" creating new partition, select partition 1, and give over 100MB to it
  * press "t" and select partition 1. Change the partition label to "b" (W95 FAT32)
   * creating other partitions as you wish
   * press "wq" write back and quit fdisk
 * sudo mkfs.vfat -n DISK_INSTALLER /dev/mmcblk0p1
