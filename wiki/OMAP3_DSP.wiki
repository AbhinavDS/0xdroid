#summary This page contains all information about OMAP3 DSP stack integration in Android

= Introduction =

OMAP3530 has C46x+ DSP core embedded in the SoC.  [http://code.google.com/p/rowboat/ Rowboat]  DSP support is based on
TI Linux Digital Video Software Development Kit (DVSDK) for OMAP3530, and 0xdroid extends the efforts of [http://code.google.com/p/rowboat/ Rowboat].

== Instructions ==

For giving a try and following this, please use beagle-donut-dsp branch:
{{{
# repo init -u git://gitorious.org/0xdroid/manifest.git -b beagle-donut-dsp -m ti-dsp.xml
}}}

and for building with dsp stack, there is a step that we need to download codec engine and specify the GStreamer/DSP support:
{{{
# make TARGET_PRODUCT=beagleboard BUILD_WITH_GST=true dvsdk
}}}
